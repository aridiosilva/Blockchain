# Blockchain

Refered as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)  makes the history of any digital asset unalterable and transparent through the use of descentralization and cryptographic hashing.

## What is a blockchain?

> **A blockchain is a special type of database. Transactions are not governed by a single party, but rather the entire transaction history is recorded in a decentralised, > distributed ledger**.

Blockchains offer groundbreaking technology with the potential to change the internet and even the world for many reasons. As we dive deeper into how blockchains work, you will find it increasingly easy to understand exactly why.

## Blockchain & distributed ledger origins

In a traditional marketplace, middlemen oversee the exchange of assets. When you receive your paycheck, for example, a bank controls the transaction. The bank validates the check, verifies that the employer holds the required funds in their account, and records the exchange. This record, or ledger, documents the transaction and the resulting change in wealth; you can look at your bank statement and see that you’re a little bit richer. For most transactions, a central entity like a bank has sole power over this ledger.

While giving control of our transactions to a central power requires a great deal of trust, it has historically been the best method for ensuring the security of the ledger. Imagine, for instance, that your employer owned the ledger instead of the bank. Your employer could falsely claim that they paid you and manipulate the records to back up their lie. Because of this security risk, neither participant in the exchange should be given sole control of the ledger. For most of history, the best way to avoid this kind of fraud was to entrust an unbiased intermediary with the ledger and hope that this middleman would faithfully maintain the ledger. In other words, traditionally, two parties who agreed upon a transaction relied on a third-party institution to carry out and record the exchange.

However, central ledgers are no longer the only viable option for exchanging our assets. Now, due to the advent of distributed ledger technologies, we can safely get our paychecks without needing to trust a bank.

## Blockchains & distributed ledgers explained

Distributed ledger technologies, like blockchain, are peer-to-peer networks that enable multiple members to maintain their own identical copy of a shared ledger. Rather than requiring a central authority to update and communicate records to all participants, DLTs allow their members to securely verify, execute, and record their own transactions without relying on a middleman.

While there are a wide variety of DLTs on the market, they are all comprised of the same building blocks: a public or private / permissioned / permissionless distributed ledger, a consensus algorithm (to ensure all copies of the ledger are identical), and a framework for incentivizing and rewarding network participation.

## Public vs. private and permissioned vs. permissionless

Distributed ledgers are categorized as “private” or “public” and “permissioned” or “permissionless” — they can be any combination of any of the two. To achieve full decentralization, Hedera believes distributed ledgers must public permissionless networks.

![path_to_decentralization](https://github.com/aridiosilva/Blockchain/blob/main/path_to_decentralization.webp)

### Private / Permissioned: 

This type of network offers no decentralization. The applications and the network nodes running those application must both be invited to join the network and meet certain criteria or provide a form of identification. Any party can also be removed without warning at any time.

### Private / Permissionless: 

Requires that applications deployed in production be invited to join the network and can be removed without warning at any time. The nodes which constitute the network and run said applications can freely and anonymously join and contribute, typically in exchange for a network’s native cryptocurrency.

### Public / Permissioned: 

Allows applications to be deployed in production or removed, without having to notify anyone, reveal their identity, or meet any application criteria requirements. The nodes which constitute the network and run said applications must be invited to join the network.

### Public / Permissionless: 

This type of network is the most decentralized. Applications can be deployed in production or removed, without having to notify anyone, reveal their identity, or meet any application criteria requirements. Additionally, the nodes which constitute the network can freely and anonymously join and contribute, typically in exchange for a network’s native cryptocurrency.

## Reaching consensus

Although every node on a permissioned or permissionless distributed ledger maintains and updates their own copy of the ledger, it is imperative that each of these ledgers remains identical. Imagine, for instance, that your copy of the ledger reveals that you have $100 in your account, while the cashier’s ledger holds that you have $1. This discrepancy would make it very difficult, if not impossible, to buy a candy bar. Without identical ledgers, participants in the network could not make transactions.

In order to keep the distributed ledger consistent, DLTs must have a consensus algorithm, or a method of ensuring that all copies of the ledger agree. A consensus algorithm is a method of synchronizing the data across a distributed system. In the case of a DLT, the consensus algorithm ensures that all copies of the ledger are identical.

There are many different consensus algorithms on the market, each with different advantages. Perhaps the most intuitive algorithm is a simple vote. According to this algorithm, each node independently calculates how they think they should update their ledger based on the information available to them. Then, each node sends this information to every other node. At this point, every node in the network has access to their decision and every other node’s decision. The nodes then calculate the majority or plurality vote, and they all update their ledgers according to this democratic consensus.

Although the simple vote is effective and intuitive, it is not efficient at scale. Because every node must send their vote to every other node, the bandwidth and processing power required to come to consensus grows exponentially with the size of the network. In other words, every additional node dramatically decreases the efficiency of the network. Because DLTs become more secure and transparent when more nodes are added to the network, many other consensus algorithms have been developed to better suit the need for large, efficient, and reliable peer-to-peer networks.

If you are curious about other consensus algorithms, you can learn about them by visiting the following pages within the learning center: voting-based consensus, economy-based consensus, and more coming soon.

## Cryptocurrency and compensating network participants

To carry out their consensus algorithms, DLTs require a significant amount of processing power per transaction. Just as DLTs distribute the responsibility of maintaining the ledger to each participant, so do they divide this computational burden. Every node must donate computing power to run the consensus algorithm and process transactions. Of course, computing power is not free.

To compensate participants for their work, and incentivize further participation, DLTs typically reward active membership with cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a virtual, encrypted token which can be exchanged using across a decentralized network. These coins can be exchanged, purchased, or earned by participating in the network.

While cryptocurrencies have no inherent value (much like fiat currency), they may be valuable to participants in a network because they are necessary for performing actions quickly, securely, and cost effectively across the decentralized network. Their usefulness as currency generates a demand for these coins. Therefore, participants have an incentive to contribute computational resources to the network. Not only is their work rewarded in cryptocurrency, the value of that currency may rise as the network grows and more build useful applications on the distributed ledger platform.

## Main Characteristics and Properties of Blockchain 

### (1) Each node contains a complete image of a blockchain’s network

Who can be trusted in a digital space, where everything can easily be copied and most users are anonymous? Blockchain can help to solve this pressing question.

### (2) A blockchain is not updated and validated by a single individual, but by hundreds, thousands, or even millions of community members in regular timeframes.

Instead of one central party such as a company, government or bank, the entire blockchain network agrees on a shared “reality”, i.e. complete history of every transaction that has ever taken place within the network. This agreement is called consensus.

### (3) Because every single transaction that has ever taken place within the network is recorded and permanently stored, it is not possible to change the ledger’s history or send the same transaction twice

This certainty creates mutual trust. In other words, participants of a blockchain network don’t even have to trust each other because no single user can cheat the system as a whole. Blockchain technology is suitable for transactions between parties that need to be verifiable and permanent, such as contracts, ownership of intellectual property, 
identification, and, of course, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

## Why are distributed ledger technologies useful?

Distributed ledger technologies allow businesses and individuals alike to quickly carry out secure transactions without needing to rely on a middleman. By avoiding intermediaries, distributing control of the ledger, and providing a tamper-apparent network, DLTs present a more cost-efficient, accessible, and reliable transaction platform than centralized ledger systems.

![distributed_ledger_uses](https://github.com/aridiosilva/Blockchain/blob/main/distributed_ledger_uses.webp)

## Remove the middleman

Because central ledgers rely on intermediaries, they are burdened by the costs and inefficiencies of the middleman. DLTs do away with these limitations by avoiding middlemen and intermediaries altogether. Without a central agent, there is no need to pay a central agent. And, without the need for clunky bureaucracy, you can exchange assets directly and immediately. You no longer have to limit the speed of your transaction to the efficiency of expensive bankers, lawyers, or politicians.

Moreover, you no longer have to trust bankers, lawyers, or politicians with the ledger and your assets. DLTs are trustless systems, meaning that no participant needs to trust any other participant to guarantee a valid ledger.

## Accessibility

While centralized systems monopolize control and limit access to their ledger, DLTs provide a much more accessible service. DLTs allow businesses and individuals to carry out transactions freely, without relying or trusting any other individual. Public DLTs take this further by issuing no restrictions on transactions or participation; no one can be denied from the platform, and no transaction will be treated with priority over another.

## Tamper-apparent

Traditional ledgers may provide fast and simple record-keeping, but they are vulnerable to corruption and hacking. Because only one central entity controls the ledger, a corrupt central agent can tamper with the records without the consent or knowledge of the affected members. Moreover, because there is only one copy of the ledger, hackers have a clear, single target for their attacks. Without visibility into whether tampering has occurred, we must simply trust that the central third-party is neither corrupt nor compromised when we use a centralized ledger.

Distributed ledgers, however, are inherently resistant to tampering. While a malicious agent could compromise a central system by altering the single ledger, they would need to alter at least a plurality of ledgers to have an impact on a distributed system.

Though DLTs are not tamper-proof, they are tamper-apparent. That is, if tampering does occur, the network’s transparency ensures that all members of the network will be aware of the change. Though a participant of a DLT cannot be completely certain that the ledger will remain unaltered, they can rest assured that they will know if tampering does occur.

Hedera Hashgraph has achieved the gold standard of security in distributed ledger consensus mechanisms, which is asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance (aBFT) and is the only distributed ledger to-date which has formally proven this quality. Hedera guarantees consensus, in real time, and is resistant to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, an area of vulnerability for some public ledger platforms.

## Immutability and controlled mutability

Some distributed ledgers take security beyond tamper-apparent by establishing immutability, preventing any and all participants from changing established records for any reason. Members of these immutable DLTs can only view the ledger and carry out new transactions. Even if all participants in the network wished to change the ledger, there would be no pathway within the system’s architecture for that change to occur. Therefore, participants of an immutable distributed ledger can be certain that their ledger is not only tamper-apparent, but tamper-proof. A distributed ledger technology is immutable if it does not provide any participant or group of participants the ability to alter or delete established records.

Of course, immutability does come with downsides. In some cases, changing past records could be beneficial. For instance, if a bug in the DLT’s code causes a transaction to be misrepresented in the ledger, immutability would prevent anyone from fixing that problem. The invalid transaction would forever be part of the official ledger. Additionally, as laws change to catch up with technology, new government regulations may necessitate a change in record-keeping practices. Immutable systems would not be able to adapt to these changing legal conditions, and would therefore risk violating government standards.

Recognizing the downsides of both mutability and immutability, some DLTs opt for controlled mutability. DLTs with controlled mutability allow records to be changed, but place heavy restrictions upon that pathway.

Controlled mutability is the best of both worlds: no malicious participant or group of participants can alter the records without everyone knowing (tamper-apparent), but the DLT can adapt to bugs and changing regulations. Hedera Hashgraph is one example of a DLT with controlled mutability. Hedera Hashgraph will establish the Hedera Council, a diverse group of businesses across nearly every industry. The council will have the ability, through unanimous vote, to remove illegal or malicious content to abide by local and global regulations. Because the council will be completely transparent and bound by term limits, participants will observe and hold the council accountable for any changes that they may make to the ledger. By having the Hedera Council, Hedera Hashgraph provides a controlled mutability that retains security while allowing the DLT to adapt to changing government standards.

## How do blockchains work?

> To ensure that the network’s transaction history is not manipulated by anyone, the community behind the network has to agree on a common “reality”.
 
In a blockchain, transactions are stored in blocks, with each newly generated block referring to the block before it with a unique identifying number called a “hash.”

These blocks constitute a chain, hence the name “blockchain”. This chain continues on indefinitely. In the case of blockchains such as Bitcoin, trust is based on technological features such as the fact that all blocks can be viewed by the public. No transaction is added to a block without first being verified by a miner - a special type of computer in the network. This way the community ensures that no fraudulent transaction is recorded in a blockchain. Consequently, a blockchain can even be used by parties who don’t necessarily trust each other to do business because they know their transactions are tamper-proof.

# What is a Node in a Blockchain Network?

There are different types, but each of them shares one specific characteristic – you’ll require specific hardware in order to host or simply connect to one.

**Blockchain technology is decentralized by nature** – one of the key properties that made it so appealing to the wide public. It’s based on the principles of a P2P (Peer to Peer) network. In most networks, there are no dedicated servers, not one authority, but a consensus among users. As they’re all crucial to the security and integrity of the network, becoming a member of a certain crypto coin community is not only exciting but also a responsibility.

**Take Bitcoin for example** – you have two types of nodes. **Full nodes ** which store a copy blockchain and thus guarantee the security and correctness of the data on the blockchain by validating data. The second type is a **lightweight node** – each user participating, who needs to connect to a full node in order to synchronize to the current state of the network and be able to participate.

# The Consensus in a Decentralized Network

In the previous section, I mentioned consensus. You might be wondering what that relates to in crypto terms. The rules by which a blockchain network operates and confirms the validity of information written in blocks and/or work performed is termed “consensus”.

As we’ve already covered, cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized P2P network. As you can imagine, agreeing on something with a large number of people is bound to lead to complications. This is where consensus algorithms come into play. The most common ones are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). The differences between the two, I’ll cover later down below. No matter which one has been chosen for a coin, they both have a crucial factor in common – reliance on full nodes for enforcing of rules and validation of transactions. While consensus must be achieved by a certain type of nodes, the beauty of a P2P network is that anyone can become a full node and thus achieve higher levels of independence and decentralization.

In the Bitcoin example – users are free to download the whole blockchain and validate blocks, thus increasing security, as more and more copies of the ledger are created and used for reference. The prime cryptocurrency offers one of the highest levels of decentralization, compared to EOS for example, where becoming a validator needs to be voted by a set number of users and the available positions are limited. This opens the network to corruption and manipulation.

The most common threat to a blockchain is the 51% attack, where more than half the network “power” is concentrated in one entity (be that a single person or collaboration between users). That allows said entity to change consensus rules as it sees fit, which could lead to a monopoly where everyone is either forced to continue with the new rules, hard fork (explained below) or abandon a project. While strict enforcement is a given during the day to day operation of the blockchain, for evolving the network, alterations need be voted on by the community and thus achieve long-term success.

## Types of Blockchain Nodes

In a nutshell, there are two main types of nodes – full nodes and light nodes. Another term to describe nodes is clients which supply wallet functions. Full ones contain а copy of the blockchain’s history, including all blocks created. Light nodes or SPV (Simple Payment Verification) nodes are all wallets that download only the headers of blocks and save hard drive space for users. Let us explore the different sub-kinds in detail.

![bitcoin nodes](https://github.com/aridiosilva/Blockchain/blob/main/Types%20of%20Nodes%20in%20a%20Blockchain%20Network.jpg)


### Full Nodes

Full nodes act as a server in a decentralized network. Their main tasks include maintaining the consensus between other nodes and verification of transactions. They also store a copy of the blockchain, thus being more secure and enable custom functions such as instant send and private transactions.

When making decisions for the future of a network, full nodes are the ones that vote on proposals. If more than 51% of them don’t agree with the proposition, it gets skipped. In some cases, this can lead to a hard fork in which the community cannot agree on a certain change and thus go their separate ways, creating two chains. The most well-known example of that happening is the Bitcoin Cash Fork.

### Pruned Full Node

One type is the pruned full node. The specific characteristic here is that it begins downloading blocks from the beginning and once it reaches the set limit, deletes the oldest ones, retaining only their headers and chain placement. For example, if you set a size limit of 550MB, you will store all the latest blocks that can fit in that hard drive space, but in order to get to that state, you would first have to go through the entire blockchain to validate all those previous blocks.

Pruned nodes are considered full nodes and thus can also verify transactions and be involved in the consensus.

### Archival Full Node

Archival full nodes are what most people refer to when talking about full nodes. They envision a server which hosts the full blockchain in its database. As I already shared with you above, their main task is to maintain consensus and validate blocks. The difference between pruned and archival node is one – the amount of hard drive space they take up on your server or PC.

Archival nodes can be divided into a couple of subtypes – those that can add blocks to the blockchain and ones that are unable too.

### Nodes Which Can Add Blocks

Let us begin by covering the main participants in the blockchain – nodes which can add blocks to it. They depend on the consensus rules being enforced and require at least one full archival node to operate.

* Miners (Mining Nodes)
* Stakers (Staking Nodes)
* Authority Nodes

### Masternodes

Compared to full nodes, masternodes themselves cannot add blocks to the blockchain. Their only purpose is to keep a record of transactions and validate them. Whether it will be miners or stakers, they’re the ones writing blocks on the blockchain. An added benefit, however, is that by running a masternode, you not only secure the network but can earn a share of the rewards for your services.

To establish a masternode, you will need to lock away a certain sum of funds as collateral. You are expected to be online 24/7 and hosting on a Virtual Private Server is considered good practice. If you’d like to learn more on how to set up your own masternode or which the best masternode coins are, you can check out masternodes.com;

### 
Lightweight (SPV) Nodes

Another type of blockchain nodes, used in day to day crypto operations, is the lightweight node or Simple Payment Verification (SPV) node. You’ve probably come across it already, but you’re most likely familiar with the “light wallet” definition.
These types of nodes communicate with the blockchain while relying on full nodes to provide them with the necessary information. As they don’t store a copy of the chain, they only query the current status for which block is last, and broadcast transactions for processing.

Having in mind the above features, it’s clear to see that running SPV node doesn’t require many resources, but it does sacrifice security for the sake of convenience.

### Lightning Nodes

Lightning nodes are a very interesting concept. They fit into the constraints of neither full nodes nor lightweight nodes as I’ve presented them to you so far.

The idea behind them is to establish a connection between users outside the blockchain. This way, the load on the network is reduced, transfer times are shortened significantly and there’s increased usability of crypto coins. Transaction fees are really low in the lightning network – the equivalent of roughly 10 to 20 satoshi in general.

The way it works is by opening a separate payment channel between entities. Take for example a bagel shop and Bob. Bob and the shop create something like a safe-deposit box (a multi-signature address) to which they both have separate keys. Bob deposits his funds and uses them to pay for bagels. Each transaction is agreed upon by both sides and happens pretty much instantly. Once he’s had enough bagels or simply runs out of money, he or the shop can close the connection, take the latest balance sheet and broadcast it onto the network.

This way, instead of waiting for each transaction to be confirmed and filling the network with space-wasting data, parties can interact between each other and lower the load on the blockchain. Furthermore, if someone else wants to deal with the same party, the lightning network will search for a path with the least number of intermediaries and lowest transfer fees, thus reducing wait times.

### What Happens to a Node After a Fork?

Now that I’ve covered the different types of cryptocurrency nodes and you’re familiar with their operation, let’s explore how that ties into the network consensus and eventual forks.

In previous paragraphs, I mentioned that if there’s not at least a 51% agreement between full nodes, a proposed change to the network is rejected. But what happens if there’s a large part of the community that still wants to accept the suggested alteration? That is where forks come into play. A developer decides to create a new client, using the source code of the coin and implements the proposed change. Users willing to go on in that direction, download the new version and decide to support the now forked chain.

### Hard Fork

In short, a hard fork is a change to the network consensus algorithm. Every alteration that is not compatible with the previous version of the client used, is considered a hard fork. Parameters of the consensus that can provoke a hard fork when changed, may include a new block reward, block time, transition from PoW to PoS, implementation of masternodes and others.

Once a hard fork is launched, every node on the network that hasn’t updated to the new version of the software is rejected by the consensus as for its operating on invalid rules. That is one of the reasons why developers and communities generally avoid major changes, as it means some people will be left out or the transition phase may compromise the security of a network.

![hard-fork-mobile](https://github.com/aridiosilva/Blockchain/blob/main/hard-fork-mobile.svg)

### Soft Fork

Another way of introducing changes to a network is via a soft fork. Contrary to hard forks, with this type of alteration, there’s no mandatory rule for users to update their nodes.

One such example is the addition of the Segregated Witness feature to Bitcoin. To this day, transactions can be made on BTC’s blockchain with or without using this feature. Once 95% of clients on the network are updated to the version that supports SegWit, the consensus will automatically change and refuse any old transactions without it. This way, we have a smoother transition that does not force users to immediately update.

### Virtual Private Servers (VPS) and Their Usage with Nodes

Whether or not you decide to use a Virtual Private Server is up to personal preference. If you decide to run a masternode, lightning node or even a cold staking node, a VPS will be beneficial as you pay a small fee in return for protection from DDoS attacks, not having to maintain any hardware and not worry about your bandwidth capabilities.

On the other hand, if you don’t take enough security precautions, you risk someone hacking into your server and stealing your funds, provided you’re storing your coins in those wallets. These are the basics, but I’d recommend researching VPS servers in detail before deciding on whether or not to rent one. 

## FAQ

### Why should I host a Full Node?

If you’re eager to support the network of a given coin or simply don’t want to rely on other full nodes for your information, you can host your own and store a copy of the blockchain. It’s more secure, however, it will take longer to set up.
   
### Is a Masternode better than a Full Node?

Masternodes and full nodes are similar in their function as discussed in the article. If your goal is to make a profit, then running a masternode would be the way to go.
    
### Can I make a Profit hosting a Blockchain Node?

Yes, but it depends on which type you decide to host. With masternodes, you will be paid for your services, but you have to consider the initial investment that you’ve locked into the masternode itself. Another option would be a staking node, it will offer you passive income which will increase as you invest more in it.
    
### How many Nodes can I run on a single Machine?

Depends on your hardware capabilities. Only one instance of a wallet may be run at the same time, so you’ll need to make use of Virtual Machines. If you decide to use a VPS, you need to make sure that you’re not using more than 80 to 85 percent of available resources, as you may be taken down, limited or some other measures may be employed by the provider.
    
### Which are the best VPS Providers?

The choice is entirely yours, however, based on my own experience and market research, some of the top suppliers include Amazon EC2, DigitalOcean Droplets, Vultr, and Microsoft Azure
